# Rock Paper Scissors Web Application

This is a simple rock paper scissors game made using python and gradio, where the user can input one of three choices and it checks against a randomly chosen result.

## How to Use This App
It's best to use a Linux command prompt like Ubuntu to execute this code. I also suggest opening up Visual Studio Code through Linux to be able to make edits tothe code.

- Operate the app in the command line with 'python app.py' or 'python3 app.py'
    - Alternatively, you can start the app in Visual Studio Code
- Go to the localhost IP that the command line or VSC stats it opened in
- Choose from the three options, then press the play button to generate a bot result. The bot's choice is random
    - Wins, losses, and ties are logged as each result is generated
